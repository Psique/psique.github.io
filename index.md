# ABOUT #
#########
about_detail: I consider myself as an open-minded person with pleasures typical of another century, although a faithful admirer of technological advances. I dedicate my spare time to personal projects related to data extraction, active listening to music and reading topics of my interest. I like to highlight my predisposition to know myself better and to grow as a better person, in my own opinion of course. In a self-taught way, I always try to improve my musical skills and my linguistic training so that I don't get caught off guard when I decide to travel the world. In addition, at the moment I am recovering the sense of working out, sport is once again key in my daily routine after a decade in the dark. <br><br>Graduated in computer engineering, I am currently <strong>working as a freelancer in web development applications</strong>. I consider myself as an enthusiast of data mining, I feel comfortable automating the net and browsing for interesting information in websites. I like scripting too and I would enjoy to provide my expertise to other people.
