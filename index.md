# ABOUT #
#########
about_detail: I consider myself an open-minded person who is discovering his fate by growing hobbies and pleasures such as coding, playing guitar and strolling out. I enjoy being surrounded by people that I admire and can relate to although I need an equivalent amount of time by myself.<br><br>Music and nature function as two blow off valves. I dedicate my spare time to personal projects related to data extraction and I do actively listen to music trying to cover some of best blues tracks. I like to have a good posture, it makes me feel capable of my dreams as well as gaining health for the years to come.<br><br>Graduated as a computer scientist, I am currently working in a native mobile application at Polaroo as a software engineer. I am an enthusiast of data mining and process orchestration and I feel comfortable automating the net and browsing for interesting information in websites.
